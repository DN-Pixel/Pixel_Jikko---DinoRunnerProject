# Pixel_Jikko---DinoRunnerProject
JavaFX project. Pretty simple : based on the dino runner google game. Just clic to jump over obstacles comming through.
Main features :
  -scaling dfficulty (obstacles spawn cooldown diminution over time)
  -animations (for the runner and the panes in the back)
  -gravity (for the jumps)
FYI:
  -comment 'playmusic' in the initialize if you want to try it out cause git still doesn't want me to upload my stuff.
  enjoy !
